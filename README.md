# About sjtu_drone #

sjtu_drone is a quadrotor simulation program developed with ROS + Gazebo. It is used for testing visual SLAM algorithms aiding with different sensors, such as IMU, sonar range finder, laser range finder. Here 'sjtu' means Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

# Requirements #
The package requires ROS indigo version (which means you'd better use Ubuntu 14.04 or Linux Mint 17 or the related later versions). The Gazebo version is suggested to be larger than 3.0. As the default version of Gazebo coming with ROS indigo is 2.0, it suggests do not use the full installation but the desktop installation:

```
$!sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full


```

```
$!sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop 
```
